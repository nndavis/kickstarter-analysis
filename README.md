# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Project Overview
 The purpose of this analysis was to give my client a view on kickstarter campaign statistics: specifically statistics of "Outcomes Based on Goal," and "Outcomes Based on Launch Date." This is per my client's request as she will be soon be launching her play "Fever." Included for my client are a couple of charts to be able to distinguish the data clearly.
  
Project Analysis and Challenges
 In this workbook there is data of kickstarter campaign statistics. With that data, I was able to create a pivot table of outcomes based on launch date, as well as create a table and line graph of outcomes based on goal. 
  Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   The pivot table is quite simple to create; excel makes it an easy task by using the pivot table button, and then I just placed the data I wanted into the respective locations. However, I was challenged on what data needed to be put under values. I didn't realize that outcomes needed to be placed under both columns and values at first. It was small and only slightly halted my progress. This pivot table is a good reference while taking minimal work to create.
  Outcomes Based on Goal
   Next was the line chart for outcomes based on goal. This took significantly more work than the pivot table. To begin, I created a new sheet and created an 8x12 data set. See here for the chart - ![kickstartchart1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104074135/177666604-74290fb8-1074-4a53-8699-6306cb499db6.jpg) A bulk of the work was creating an algorithm to pull the correct number for each corresponding cell. We'll take B2 for example, Number successful Less Than 1000, the code I used here is: =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D,"<1000", Kickstarter!F:F,"successful",Kickstarter!R:R,"plays"). I pulled information from the main sheet and put in the corresponding value based on the goal. I did this for each cell in columns B:D while slightly modifying each one. After that it was relatively easy to pull percentages using a sum function. The only challenge I had to overcome with this was not recognizing I needed to pull data from plays. This was easy to add in to each cell once I realized I was missing it. Overall, the line chart was more challenging and took more time to complete.

Results
 With the data I've pulled it is time to create some conclusions. To start, I know that theater outcomes are the highest in the month of May. December shows that the fail rate is closest to the success rate. With that information, we can conclude that May would be the ideal month for a launch date while December is the worst. Moving on to outcomes based on goal, it shows the highest success rate is when the goal is sub 1000. The highest failed rate would be from 45000 to 49999, though there is not much data to pull, so the next highest failed rate is the 50000 ore more goal. With this data, it's evident that the lower goals typically have a higher success rate. 
  Related data
   There is more that could be done within this workbook. For example, it could prove useful to look at the deadline goals and correspond those to success rates. That way my client could appropriately manage how much time to spend on their project. There also seems to be some limitations with the current data. Looking at the outcomes based on goal, there is no canceled projects; taking a look at the theater outcomes by launch date, there is canceled data. It could prove useful to have both charts show data for theater as a whole as well as plays. To conclude, there was great data pulled with this workbook, but there is the opportunity to do more.
